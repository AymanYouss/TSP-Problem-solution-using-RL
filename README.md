# TSP Problem Solution Using Reinforcement Learning

This Python project utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, specifically SARSA, to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP involves finding the most optimized trajectory for a delivery company primarily based in Denmark.

## Overview

The project focuses on creating and plotting the most optimized trajectory for the delivery company using the SARSA reinforcement learning approach. The main goal is to compare the model's solution with the heuristic approach solution. Running both files (`main_project.ipynb` and other relevant files) allows you to observe the difference in accuracy and execution time.

## Usage

To visualize the optimized solution for the given dataset, run the main file:

- **main_project.ipynb**

You can also change the dataset, provided it follows the same column values as the `clean_data` file.

## Files

1. **main_project.ipynb:** The main file for plotting the optimized solution for the given dataset.
2. **clean_data:** Dataset with columns suitable for the algorithm.
3. (Other relevant files)
