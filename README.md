# TSP-Problem-solution-using-RL
Implementing a solution for the traveling salesman problem using reinforcement learning.

The project consists of creating and plotting the most optimized trajectory for a delivery company mainly based in denmark. The reinforcement learning approach used is SARSA.

You can find a comparison between the model's solution and the heurisric approach solution. Run both files to see the difference in accuracy and execution time.

The main file to run for plotting the optimized solution for the given dataset is on the file : main_project.ipynb.

You can change the dataset as long as it fits the algorithm (same column values as the clean_data file).
